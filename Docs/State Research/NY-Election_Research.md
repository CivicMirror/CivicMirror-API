## Source Coverage Analysis

New York is among the more capable state sources, offering a searchable elections database, live election night reporting (`nyenr.elections.ny.gov`), certified results downloads back to 2011, and OpenElections CSVs for historical depth. The new Dr. John L. Flateau Database Act (effective April 1, 2026) will further mandate election-district-level structured data, though implementation is pending. Primary gaps are candidate contact/bio/platform information and officials/incumbency data, which should be supplemented with **Google Civic Information API** (candidates, offices, districts by address), **Ballotpedia** (candidate bios, ballot measures detail, incumbency), **OpenStates** (NY state legislative data), and **OpenFEC** (federal campaign finance). GeoJSON district boundaries remain unconfirmed from the state source and should be sourced via Google Civic API until the Flateau Act's structured data becomes available.
