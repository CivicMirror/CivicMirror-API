## CivicMirror Integration Coverage

Tracks Stage 1 (Election + Race Creation) and Stage 2 (Results Ingestion) implementation status per state.

| Code | State | Stage 1 — Election Creation | Stage 1 — Race Creation | Stage 2 — Results Ingestion |
|------|-------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **WV** | West Virginia | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete (14 races in prod) | ✅ Complete — Clarity adapter (`wv.py`) |
| **CO** | Colorado | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete (races in prod) | ✅ Complete — Clarity adapter (`co.py`) |
| **SC** | South Carolina | ✅ Available | ⚠️ Bootstrap only (post-election) | ✅ Adapter built — Clarity (`sc.py`) |
| **IA** | Iowa | ✅ Available | ⚠️ Bootstrap only (post-election) | ✅ Adapter built — Clarity (`ia.py`) |
| **CA** | California | ✅ Available | ✅ 38 races in prod (Civic API + SOS REST) | ❌ No adapter |
| **PA** | Pennsylvania | ✅ Available | ⚠️ Blocked (2026 data not yet published) | ❌ Pending Socrata adapter |
| **MI** | Michigan | ✅ Available | ⚠️ Blocked (`michiganelections.io` 503) | ❌ Pending API recovery |
| All others | — | ✅ Available (Civic API) | ⚠️ Untested | ❌ No adapter |

**Full Coverage** (all three stages ✅): **WV**, **CO**  
**Adapter built, bootstrap path**: **SC**, **IA** (need `results_url` set in Django admin)  
**Blocked adapters**: PA (data publication ~2-4 weeks), MI (API 503)
