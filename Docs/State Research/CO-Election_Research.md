## Source Coverage Analysis

Colorado's combination of the Clarity Elections platform (live results) and the `historicalelectiondata.coloradosos.gov` database (1902–present) provides excellent election result and ballot question coverage, making it one of the stronger state sources for raw results data. However, candidate contact information, biographical data, platform statements, incumbent status, term dates, and district boundary GeoJSON are entirely absent from state-provided sources. **Google Civic API** should fill district, incumbent, and candidate contact gaps; **Ballotpedia** provides candidate profiles and platform content; **OpenStates** covers state legislative officials; and **EAVS/EAC** supplements election administration statistics. The Clarity feed (`results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/`) enables structured real-time XML/JSON ingestion during election night without additional engineering.
