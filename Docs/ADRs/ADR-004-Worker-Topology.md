# ADR-004: Celery Worker Topology — Cloud Run Service

## Status
Accepted

## Context

CivicMirror API uses Celery for all background ingestion tasks. Current scheduled workload:

| Task | Cloud Scheduler job | Schedule (UTC) | Typical duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sync_elections` + `sync_election_races` | `sync-elections-hourly` (Cloud Run Job) | Hourly | 2–5 s + 1–15 s/election |
| `poll_pending_results` + `ingest_official_results` | `poll-pending-results` | Daily 06:00 | 5–60 s (fan-out) |
| `sync_openstates_all_states` + `sync_openstates_legislators` | `sync-openstates` | Daily 02:00 | seconds + 30–120 s/state |
| `sync_fec_candidates` | `sync-fec` | Every 6 hours | 60–300 s (throttled API) |
| `sync_sc_elections` + `sync_sc_races` | `sync-sc-vrems` | Daily 01:00 | 5–30 s + varies |
| `sync_co_elections` + `sync_co_candidates` | `sync-co-sos` | Daily 02:00 | 10–60 s |
| `sync_ia_elections` + `sync_ia_candidates` | `sync-ia-sos` | Daily 02:00 | 30–180 s (PDF parse + proxy) |
| `sync_ma_elections` → `sync_ma_races` + `sync_ma_ballot_question` | `sync-ma-sos` | Daily 03:00 | 5–15 min (HTML scrape + CSV fan-out) |
| `sync_va_elections` → `sync_va_races` | `sync-va-elect` | Daily 03:30 | 10–20 min (ENR JSON fan-out, 1–3 MB/slug) |

**Scheduling rationale for 03:00 / 03:30 slots:**  
The 02:00 slot already carries 3 concurrent tasks (IA, CO, OpenStates). MA and VA each fan out to N subtasks; placing them 30 minutes apart avoids simultaneous queue drain from two heavy fan-out workloads. Both complete before `poll-pending-results` at 06:00.

**MA SOS data note:** `electionstats.state.ma.us` is post-certification only — no live ENR feed. Daily cadence is sufficient; data does not change intra-day.

**VA ELECT data note:** Enhanced Voting API provides live ENR (`isOfficialResults` flag). During election night the data changes frequently; the `asOf` timestamp in the results adapter prevents redundant DB writes when data hasn't changed.

### Options considered

#### Option A — Cloud Run Jobs

Cloud Run Jobs run a container to completion for each invocation. They bill per CPU-second and have no minimum instance cost.

**Pros:** Zero cost between runs; no always-on container.  
**Cons:** 5–20 second cold start for every task invocation; unsuitable for fan-out tasks (each sub-task requires its own job invocation); cannot consume from a Redis queue; requires direct invocation or Pub/Sub trigger per task.

Cloud Run Jobs are a poor fit for a Celery architecture because Celery workers pull tasks from a queue. Jobs do not support long-lived queue polling.

#### Option B — Cloud Run Service (chosen)

A separate Cloud Run **service** runs the Celery worker as a long-lived process (`celery -A config worker`). The service:

- Keeps `min-instances=1` so the worker is always ready to pull tasks.
- Uses the same Docker image as the API service; the `CMD` is overridden via the Cloud Run service configuration to `["worker"]` (handled by `docker-entrypoint.sh`).
- Scales beyond 1 instance under high task load (Cloud Run autoscaling on CPU).

**Pros:** Matches Celery's pull-from-queue model exactly; zero cold starts for task processing; familiar operational model; one image for both services.  
**Cons:** Minimum 1 always-on instance (small, predictable cost ~$5–10/month at 256 MB).

## Decision

Run Celery workers as a **Cloud Run Service** with `min-instances=1`.

The Django API service runs in a separate Cloud Run Service with `min-instances=0` (scales to zero between requests).

### Service configuration summary

| Service | Image | CMD | min-instances | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `civicmirror-api` | `civicmirror-api:$SHA` | `api` | 0 | 512 MB |
| `civicmirror-worker` | `civicmirror-api:$SHA` | `worker` | 1 | 512 MB |

Both services use the same Docker image tag (built once in CI, deployed to both services). The entrypoint selects the correct process based on the `CMD` argument.

### Why not separate images?

A single image ensures the API and worker always run identical code and dependencies. Version drift between API and worker is a common source of subtle bugs in distributed systems.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Task processing begins within milliseconds of enqueueing.
- Fan-out tasks (OpenStates all-states, poll_pending_results) work correctly.
- Single image tag simplifies deployment rollback.
- Worker restarts are handled automatically by Cloud Run health checks.

### Negative
- The worker service incurs a baseline ~$5–10/month cost (1 × 512 MB minimum instance).
- Worker cannot scale to zero; a runaway task loop would keep the instance alive.
